The program allows for keys to be used as a synthesier.
Each key corresponds to a different note in a scale.


On starting the program the user will be asked if they would like to freeplay or learn a song.
This choice (and the following choices) are made via number input in the terminal.

Freeplay allows for the user to play notes as they like with the corresponding note playing and LED
lighting upon on pressing each key.  Mulitple keys can be pressed at once to produce a chord.

After freeplay if a player wishes to learn a song they must stop the program and run again from beginning.

Learn a song allows the user to be taught to play a tune using the synthesier.
The User on selecting this option will be asked to choose a song, currently the options are twinkle twinkle little star or Old MacDonald,
though additional songs could be added to the code.
Once a song is selected the user may choose to either hear the song before they play it or go straight to learning the song themselves.
Hearing the song plays the tune and lights up the correspondiong LEDs and then asks the user to play the song
Learn skips playing the tune.
Once the tune has been played the program finishes.
After Learning a song if a player wishes to freeplay they must stop the program and run again from beginning.
